            The Circus of Wonders isn't just a show; it's a smart city with its
            own citizensâ€”the performers, vendors, and roadies. But as this city
            springs up overnight, its infrastructure often breaks down: main
            pathways become damaged, water lines to the caravans leak, and
            garbage piles up. Our mission is to build a formal grievance
            tracker where any circus citizen can report these municipal issues
            and watch them get resolved, ensuring their traveling city runs as
            smoothly as the show itself.
